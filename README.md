This dashboard empowers local councils to allocate enforcement and monitoring resources efficiently by identifying parking offence hotspots through the total cases by location chart. 
Using the heatmap of offence cases by weekdays and hours, councils can further optimise patrol schedules to times with peak violations. 
Additionally, the offences summarized by year map provides a longitudinal overview, enabling trend analysis and comparison between different offence types over the years. 
This predictive insight supports data-driven decision-making to improve parking compliance and urban mobility management.
